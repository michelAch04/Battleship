# Battleship

Hey! This project is something I worked on in my second year as a computer engineer. It is about implementing the battleship game using Java (OOP).
It was submitted as my Object-Oriented Design course's midterm project.
The implementation contains PVP on the same machine and Player vs CPU, where the CPU has three difficulties: Easy, Medium and Hard.
This is a basic Java code, and even the implementation of the CPU is not very advanced (no pattern recognition or intelligence), but nevertheless it runs!
When you run it, a simulation of a board interface will appear after configuration of mode, since the project was done for learning how to program in Java, not how to design game graphics.
Happy Coding!
